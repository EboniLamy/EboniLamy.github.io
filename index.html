<h1>Eboni is a Champ</h1>
<p>Welcome to the world's greatest site.  </p>
Here you will find a couple of facts about myself. For starters, I am a 10th grader and I attend Hardee Senior High School in Wauchula, Florida.  I love food, shoes, and basketball. I was the starting point guard as a freshman. I already know what you're thinking. You're probably saying "wow she is one great basketball player." I am here to tell you that your assumptions are correct. My team mates called me spaghetti, not only because of my height and size, but because I'm so saucy.

I will soon be so rich to buy this fancy Tesla. <img src="http://europe.autonews.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/storyimage/CA/20180220/ANE/180219831/AR/0/Tesla.jpg&MaxW=622&cci_ts=20180225162915" alt="Tesla">
